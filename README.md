# macro-challenges

Learn Clojure macros with [speclj](https://github.com/slagyr/speclj).
The test cases in this project's spec directory show expansions of a
few core Clojure macros. My implementations are in
macro-challenges/core, but you can delete them and write your own.
Hours of metaprogramming metafun guaranteed.

Currently included:
- `and`
- `or`
- `when`
- `when-not`
- `when-let`
- `while`
- `->`
